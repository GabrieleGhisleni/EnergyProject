Big data project.

The website for the API meteo: https://openweathermap.org/
--> Partial documentation (only the API i'm using): https://openweathermap.org/current
----> There is an API for each purpose, for instance one for the forecast and one for the current time.
---------> There is also the storico but you must pay.
