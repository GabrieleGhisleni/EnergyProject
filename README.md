Big data project.

The website for the API meteo: https://openweathermap.org/
1) Partial documentation (only the API i'm using): https://openweathermap.org/current.
2) There is an API for each purpose, for instance one for the forecast and one for the current time.
3) There is also the storico but you must pay.
